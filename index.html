   <h1> Hello I am Benjamin </h1>
   <img src="profile-picture/profile-picture.png" id="Benjamin">

   <h2>⚽ Sports ⚽</h2>
   <p>At EMLV students must practice a sport each year. That is a great rule for me because I like sports in general. Whether individual or collective sport. I have practiced football, basketball and tennis. I am huge fan of football and my favorite team is : l'Olympique de Marseille which is a French Team.

   <h3>✈️ Travels ✈️</h3>
   <p>I enjoy travelling to discover new places, cultures and people. When I am older, I hope to have travelled to each continent on the planet ! For now, I have only discovered Europe and a  bit of Africa.

   <h4>🚗 Cars 🚗</h4>
   <p>Cars have been a revelation since I started to drive. I had the learner's permit which allowed me to drive with a relative but now I have my driver license and I feel so independant while I am driving alone. Now, when I am walking around in the streets, I always look at the cars around me, I can't resist.
